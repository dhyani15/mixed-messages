## General Info ##

This is a project inspired while I was completing codecademy backend engineering course.

The program generates a random rapper name from a list of common words found in today's popular rappers.

## Technologies ##

* JavaScript
* Node.js

## Setup ##

Download the script.js file and use `node script.js`. This is assuming that you have node installed.

## Status ##

I have closed the project for now, but I will revisit this project in the future to implement a similar mixed message concept to a pop culture reference. It's a function of when I get a cool enough idea. Any suggestions are welcome!
